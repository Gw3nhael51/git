# üé≤ Python Dice Roll Generator

This mini-script simulates a classic dice roll (1 to 6) and randomly selects a fruit from a list using Python's `random` module.

---

## üîç Example Code

```python
import random

# Generate a number between 1 and 6 like a dice
random_integer = random.randint(1, 6)
print(f"Dice result: {random_integer}")

# Choose a fruit from a list
fruit = ["apple", "orange", "cherry", "pear"]
selected_fruit = random.choice(fruit)
print(f"Selected fruit: {selected_fruit}")
```

## üêç Activate Python Environment

Open the terminal in your project directory: `*/your_project_name/random_dice/`  
Type the command: `./py_env_3.11/Scripts/activate` to activate the Python environment.  
Check the Python version: `python --version` (should display version 3.11.8)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Python Script

Once the environment is activated, you can run the script. Navigate to the folder containing your file (e.g., `main.py`) and type the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see a random result between 1 and 6, and a randomly selected fruit, for example:

```
Dice result: 4
Selected fruit: orange
```

## üìù Code Explanation

- `import random`: imports the Python module for generating random numbers and making random selections.
- `random.randint(1, 6)`: generates a random integer between 1 and 6 (inclusive), simulating a classic dice roll.
- `print(f"Dice result: {random_integer}")`: displays the dice roll result in the terminal.
- `fruit = ["apple", "orange", "cherry", "pear"]`: creates a list of fruits.
- `random.choice(fruit)`: randomly selects one fruit from the list.
- `print(f"Selected fruit: {selected_fruit}")`: displays the randomly selected fruit in the terminal.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Tips

- If the `python` command does not work, try `python3`.
- Make sure the virtual environment is activated (the terminal prompt should change).
- If you get an error about the `random` module, ensure you are using a standard Python installation (the module is included by default).

## üìö Going Further

- Try modifying the script to roll multiple dice at once.
- Add a loop to let the user roll the dice or pick a fruit as many times as they want.
- Explore other modules from the Python standard library to enhance your script.
